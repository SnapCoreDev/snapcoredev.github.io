## Behind the Logo: How SnapCore Found Its Identity

We didn’t follow a textbook. The logo just happened.  
What began as simple text grew through iteration—flat, gradient, and finally a subtle 3D effect.  
Each step wasn’t planned, it was discovered.

## ✨ The Spark

SnapCore needed a visual identity. Not perfection, not polish—just something true.  
The first version was plain text: bold, clear, and functional. It worked, but it didn’t *feel* alive.

## 🔄 The Iterations

- **Flat text** → clarity, but too static.  
- **Gradient** → depth, a hint of movement.  
- **3D effect** → suddenly, SnapCore felt tangible, like it belonged in the digital space.  

Iteration wasn’t a checklist. It was a conversation with the design itself.

## 🌐 Philosophy in Design

The logo reflects our manifesto:

- Bold text for clarity.  
- Blue for trust and reliability.  
- Tagline for philosophy: **Trust at the Core.**  

It’s not engineered—it’s discovered.  
Identity grows through iteration, honesty, and collaboration.

## 🎯 The Moment It Clicked

When the 3D version appeared, it wasn’t just a logo anymore.  
It was SnapCore.  
Alive, resilient, and ready to anchor our journey.

**Trust at the Core**
